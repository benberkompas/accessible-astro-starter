## Overview

Airtable bridges the gap between spreadsheets and databases, making relational data accessible to users who aren't database experts. This audit explores how their object model achieves this.

## Object Hierarchy

**Base** - The top-level container:
- Contains multiple tables
- Has shared settings and permissions
- Supports views and automations

**Table** - A collection of records:
- Similar to a database table
- Has fields (columns) with types
- Can link to other tables

**Record** - A single row in a table:
- Contains field values
- Can be linked to records in other tables
- Supports attachments and rich content

**Field** - A column definition:
- Has a type (text, number, date, link, etc.)
- Can have validation rules
- Supports formulas and rollups

**View** - A filtered/sorted presentation:
- Shows a subset of records
- Has specific field visibility
- Supports different layouts (grid, kanban, calendar)

## Relationship Model

- Base → Tables (one-to-many)
- Table → Records (one-to-many)
- Table → Fields (one-to-many)
- Record → Record (many-to-many, through link fields)
- Table → Views (one-to-many)

## Mental Model Translation

Airtable translates database concepts into familiar spreadsheet language:

1. **Base = Workbook**: Users understand workbooks from Excel
2. **Table = Sheet**: Tables feel like spreadsheet tabs
3. **Record = Row**: Records are just rows with more structure
4. **Field = Column**: Fields are columns with types

## Key Design Decisions

**Link Fields**: Instead of foreign keys, Airtable uses "link" fields that feel like references between records.

**View Abstraction**: Views separate data from presentation, allowing multiple perspectives on the same data.

**Type System**: Field types provide structure while maintaining flexibility.

## Strengths

- **Familiar Metaphors**: Spreadsheet concepts reduce learning curve
- **Flexible Relationships**: Link fields make relationships visible and editable
- **Multiple Views**: Different views support different use cases

## Challenges

- **Scalability**: The spreadsheet metaphor can break down with large datasets
- **Complex Relationships**: Many-to-many relationships can become confusing
- **Performance**: Rich features can slow down with large bases

## Insights for Designers

Airtable shows how to:
- Translate technical concepts into familiar metaphors
- Make relationships visible and editable
- Balance flexibility with structure
- Support multiple mental models through views
