## Overview

GitHub has evolved from a code hosting platform to a comprehensive development workflow tool. This audit examines how GitHub structures projects, issues, and pull requests to support team collaboration.

## Primary Objects

**Repository** - The code container:
- Contains code, issues, and pull requests
- Has settings and permissions
- Supports branches and tags

**Issue** - Work items and discussions:
- Can be bugs, features, or questions
- Has labels, assignees, and milestones
- Can be linked to pull requests

**Pull Request** - Code change proposals:
- Links to branches
- Contains code changes and discussion
- Can close issues when merged
- Has review status and approvals

**Project** - Kanban-style boards:
- Contains cards (issues/PRs)
- Has columns for workflow states
- Supports automation and rules

**Milestone** - Goal-oriented groupings:
- Contains issues and PRs
- Has due dates and progress tracking
- Helps organize work around releases

## Relationship Structure

- Repository → Issues (one-to-many)
- Repository → Pull Requests (one-to-many)
- Repository → Projects (one-to-many)
- Issue → Pull Request (one-to-one, when linked)
- Milestone → Issues (one-to-many)
- Project → Cards (one-to-many, cards reference issues/PRs)

## Workflow Patterns

**Issue-Driven Development**: Issues define work, PRs implement solutions, and merging closes issues.

**Project Boards**: Visualize workflow states, making progress visible to the team.

**Milestone Planning**: Group work around releases or goals.

## Mental Model

GitHub's model supports multiple workflows:

1. **Code-Centric**: Repository is the primary container, everything relates to code.

2. **Issue-Driven**: Issues define work, PRs implement it, projects track it.

3. **Visual Management**: Projects provide kanban-style visualization of workflow.

## Design Strengths

- **Flexible Workflows**: Supports different team structures and processes
- **Clear Relationships**: Issues, PRs, and projects have explicit connections
- **Context Preservation**: All related information stays together

## Challenges

- **Complexity**: Many features can be overwhelming
- **Workflow Customization**: Teams need to configure projects to match their process
- **Notification Management**: With many repositories, staying informed is difficult

## Key Insights

For development tools:
- Support multiple workflow patterns
- Make relationships between work items explicit
- Provide visual and list-based views
- Enable automation to reduce manual work
