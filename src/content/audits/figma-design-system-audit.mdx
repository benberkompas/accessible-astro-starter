## Overview

Figma has become the standard tool for UI design, in part because of how it models design systems. This audit explores the object relationships that make design systems work in Figma.

## Core Objects

**Components** - Reusable design elements that can be:
- Instanced across files
- Updated from a master component
- Varied through component properties

**Variants** - Different states or configurations of a component:
- Organized into variant groups
- Controlled through properties (boolean, text, instance swap)

**Styles** - Shared visual properties:
- Text styles
- Color styles
- Effect styles

**Frames** - Containers that organize content:
- Can be nested
- Support auto-layout
- Define responsive behavior

## Relationship Structure

- Components → Variants (one-to-many)
- Components → Styles (many-to-many)
- Instances → Components (many-to-one)
- Frames → Frames (parent-child nesting)

## Mental Model

Figma's object model mirrors how designers think about design systems:

1. **Master-Instance Pattern**: Components work like symbols in traditional design tools, but with more flexibility.

2. **Property-Based Variants**: Variants use properties rather than separate components, reducing duplication.

3. **Style Inheritance**: Styles can be shared across components, creating consistency.

## System Strengths

- **Scalability**: The component system scales from small teams to large organizations
- **Consistency**: Master components ensure design consistency across projects
- **Flexibility**: Variants allow components to adapt to different contexts

## Design Implications

For design tool builders, Figma shows how:
- Object relationships can mirror mental models
- Abstraction layers (components, variants, styles) reduce complexity
- Instance relationships enable efficient updates
