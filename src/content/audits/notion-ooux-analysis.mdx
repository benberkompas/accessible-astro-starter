## Overview

Notion has become one of the most popular workspace tools by combining notes, databases, wikis, and project management into a single platform. This OOUX audit examines how Notion structures its object model and how that impacts user understanding and workflow.

## Object Mapping

### Core Objects

**Pages** - The fundamental building block. Pages can contain:
- Text content
- Nested pages (creating hierarchies)
- Database views
- Embeds and media

**Databases** - Structured collections that can be viewed in multiple ways:
- Table view
- Board view (Kanban)
- Calendar view
- Gallery view
- List view

**Blocks** - Atomic content units within pages (paragraphs, headings, images, etc.)

### Key Relationships

- Pages can contain other Pages (parent-child relationship)
- Pages can contain Databases
- Databases contain Pages (each row is a page)
- Blocks belong to Pages
- Pages can be linked to other Pages

## Mental Model Analysis

Notion's mental model is built around the concept of "everything is a page." This creates both power and complexity:

**Strengths:**
- Consistent interaction patterns across different content types
- Flexible nesting allows for deep organization
- Database rows as pages enables rich content within structured data

**Challenges:**
- The "page as database row" concept can be confusing initially
- Relationship between databases and pages requires mental translation
- Nested page hierarchies can become difficult to navigate

## System Architecture Insights

The object model reveals several design decisions:

1. **Unified Content Model**: By making everything a page, Notion reduces the number of distinct object types users must learn.

2. **Flexible Relationships**: Pages can link to other pages, creating a graph-like structure that supports various organizational patterns.

3. **View Abstraction**: Databases separate the data model from the presentation, allowing multiple views of the same underlying structure.

## Recommendations

For teams building similar workspace tools, consider:

- How to balance flexibility with clarity
- When to introduce complexity vs. keeping things simple
- How object relationships can support or hinder user workflows
