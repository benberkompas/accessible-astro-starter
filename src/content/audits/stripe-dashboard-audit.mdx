## Overview

Stripe's merchant dashboard is a complex financial tool that must balance power with clarity. This audit examines how Stripe structures its object model to help merchants understand their business.

## Primary Objects

**Account** - The merchant account, containing:
- Business information
- Connected accounts (for platforms)
- Settings and configurations

**Payments** - Individual payment transactions:
- Belong to Customers
- Associated with Invoices
- Have status (succeeded, failed, pending)
- Include metadata and line items

**Customers** - People or businesses making payments:
- Have payment methods
- Associated with subscriptions
- Contain payment history

**Invoices** - Billing documents:
- Contain line items
- Associated with subscriptions
- Generate payments

**Subscriptions** - Recurring billing relationships:
- Have plans and pricing
- Generate invoices
- Track billing cycles

## Object Relationships

- Account → Customers (one-to-many)
- Customers → Payments (one-to-many)
- Customers → Subscriptions (one-to-many)
- Subscriptions → Invoices (one-to-many)
- Invoices → Payments (one-to-one, typically)

## Mental Model Challenges

Financial systems have inherent complexity:

1. **Temporal Relationships**: Payments, invoices, and subscriptions have time-based relationships that can be confusing.

2. **Status Transitions**: Objects move through various states (pending → succeeded → refunded), requiring clear status communication.

3. **Error States**: Failed payments, declined cards, and disputes create additional object states that must be handled.

## Design Patterns

**Hierarchical Organization**: Account → Customer → Payment creates clear ownership chains.

**Status Visibility**: Payment and subscription statuses are prominently displayed to reduce confusion.

**Contextual Actions**: Actions are available based on object state (e.g., "Refund" only for succeeded payments).

## Key Insights

1. **Clarity Over Features**: Stripe prioritizes making complex financial concepts understandable.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are hidden until needed, reducing cognitive load.

3. **Error Recovery**: The object model supports clear error states and recovery paths.

## Recommendations

For financial product design:
- Make object relationships explicit
- Provide clear status indicators
- Support error recovery in the object model
- Use progressive disclosure for complexity
