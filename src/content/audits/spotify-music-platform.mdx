## Overview

Spotify has revolutionized music consumption by making vast libraries accessible through intelligent organization. This audit examines the object model that makes music discovery and library management work.

## Core Objects

**Track** - Individual songs:
- Belongs to Albums
- Performed by Artists
- Has metadata (duration, genre, etc.)
- Can be in multiple Playlists

**Album** - Collections of tracks:
- Created by Artists
- Has release dates and artwork
- Contains multiple tracks in sequence

**Artist** - Music creators:
- Create Albums
- Perform Tracks
- Have profiles and followers
- Can be followed by Users

**Playlist** - User-created collections:
- Contains Tracks
- Created by Users
- Can be collaborative
- Has descriptions and artwork

**User Library** - Personal collection:
- Saved Albums
- Saved Tracks
- Followed Artists
- Followed Playlists

## Relationship Patterns

- Artist → Albums (one-to-many)
- Album → Tracks (one-to-many)
- Artist → Tracks (many-to-many, through albums)
- User → Playlists (one-to-many)
- Playlist → Tracks (many-to-many)
- User → Library (one-to-one)
- Library → Albums, Tracks, Artists (many-to-many)

## Mental Model

Spotify's model reflects how people think about music:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Artist → Album → Track mirrors physical music organization.

2. **Flexible Grouping**: Playlists allow custom organization beyond albums.

3. **Personal Collection**: Library provides a "my music" mental model.

## Design Patterns

**Discovery Through Relationships**: 
- "Fans also like" uses artist relationships
- "Similar to" uses track metadata
- Playlists suggest related tracks

**Context Preservation**:
- Playing a track shows its album and artist
- Navigation maintains context (album → artist → similar artists)

**Library Management**:
- Save vs. Follow distinction (albums/tracks vs. artists/playlists)
- Download for offline access

## System Strengths

- **Rich Metadata**: Extensive tagging enables powerful discovery
- **Relationship Exploration**: Easy navigation between related content
- **Personalization**: Library and playlists create personal experiences

## Challenges

- **Scale Complexity**: Millions of tracks require efficient organization
- **Discovery Overload**: Too many options can be paralyzing
- **Library Management**: Large libraries become difficult to navigate

## Key Takeaways

For content platforms:
- Mirror real-world organization patterns
- Support both structured (albums) and flexible (playlists) organization
- Use relationships to enable discovery
- Balance personalization with exploration
