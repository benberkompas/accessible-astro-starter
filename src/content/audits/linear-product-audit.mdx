## Overview

Linear has reimagined issue tracking by focusing on speed, clarity, and developer experience. This audit examines how their object model supports rapid iteration and clear communication.

## Object Model

### Primary Objects

**Issues** - The core work unit. Each issue represents:
- A task, bug, or feature request
- Belongs to a Project
- Has a Team assignment
- Contains comments, attachments, and history

**Projects** - Collections of issues organized around:
- Product initiatives
- Sprints or milestones
- Feature releases

**Teams** - Organizational units that own issues and projects

**Cycles** - Time-bound iterations (similar to sprints)

### Relationship Patterns

- Issues → Projects (many-to-one)
- Issues → Teams (many-to-one)
- Issues → Cycles (many-to-one, optional)
- Projects → Teams (many-to-one)

## Design Patterns

**Minimal Object Types**: Linear intentionally limits object types to reduce cognitive load. This contrasts with tools like Jira that offer extensive customization.

**Clear Ownership**: Every issue has explicit team ownership, reducing ambiguity about who's responsible.

**Temporal Organization**: Cycles provide a lightweight way to group work by time without the overhead of formal sprint management.

## Key Insights

1. **Simplicity Through Constraint**: By limiting object types, Linear makes the system easier to understand and use.

2. **Relationship Clarity**: The explicit relationships (issue → project → team) create clear mental models.

3. **Workflow Optimization**: The object model directly supports common engineering workflows without requiring extensive configuration.

## Takeaways

Linear demonstrates how a well-designed object model can make complex work management feel simple and fast.
