## Overview

Slack has redefined workplace communication by organizing conversations around channels rather than individual messages. This audit examines the object model that makes this work.

## Core Objects

**Workspace** - The top-level organization:
- Contains teams and members
- Has settings and configurations
- Manages billing and subscriptions

**Channels** - Conversation spaces:
- Can be public or private
- Have members
- Contain messages and threads
- Support integrations and apps

**Messages** - Individual communication units:
- Belong to channels or DMs
- Can be threaded
- Support reactions and files
- Have timestamps and authors

**Threads** - Nested conversations:
- Belong to parent messages
- Keep related discussions organized
- Reduce channel noise

**Direct Messages** - Private conversations:
- Between two or more users
- Function like channels but private
- Contain messages and files

## Relationship Structure

- Workspace → Channels (one-to-many)
- Workspace → Members (one-to-many)
- Channels → Messages (one-to-many)
- Messages → Threads (one-to-many)
- Messages → Reactions (one-to-many)
- Users → DMs (many-to-many)

## Mental Model

Slack's model centers on **channels as places**:

1. **Spatial Metaphor**: Channels feel like rooms where conversations happen.

2. **Threading Reduces Noise**: Threads allow detailed discussions without cluttering the main channel.

3. **Membership Defines Access**: Channel membership determines what users can see and do.

## Design Strengths

- **Clear Hierarchy**: Workspace → Channel → Message creates intuitive navigation
- **Flexible Organization**: Channels can be organized by topic, project, or team
- **Context Preservation**: Threads keep related messages together

## System Challenges

- **Notification Complexity**: With many channels, managing notifications becomes difficult
- **Information Overload**: High-activity channels can become overwhelming
- **Search Challenges**: Finding specific information across many channels requires good search

## Key Takeaways

For communication tools:
- Spatial metaphors help users understand organization
- Threading can reduce noise while preserving context
- Membership models need to balance access with privacy
- Search becomes critical as scale increases
