## Overview

Covenant Eyes helps people break free from pornography through relationship-focused accountability. Our paid service monitors, evaluates and relays activity from their devices to a person of their choosing, encouraging them toward transparency and honesty.

This is obviously an ultra-private, ultra-sensitive space! The stakes can be enormously high, with marriages in disarray, trust hanging by a thread, and devastated people pulling away from those they love, retreating further into secrecy and isolation.

## Context

### History of courses

We began offering short courses as a way to advance our mission of “helping the world to live porn-free”. They were available for free to anyone who created an account, so even people who weren’t ready or able to subscribe to our paid accountability service could begin their journey to victory.

Over the years these courses never contributed noticeably to revenue, conversion, or retention. They were simply aimed at delivering customer value. That was it.

### Deciding to expand

Colleagues had mixed feelings about whether courses could (or should) be considered as a potential revenue driver for us, but as soon as we began thinking about expanding *beyond* courses and offering a fuller set of recovery-focused features, there was a renewed interest in the possibility.

After all, expansion revenue is an important goal for most SaaS companies. This is about building additional revenue streams besides your core subscription revenue.

We had recently overhauled our main navigation and carved out a section labeled “Grow” to signal our intent to go beyond courses but nobody knew exactly what that meant. We had a lot of ideas, but that’s the easy part!

Our Recovery Education team had the clearest vision of anyone, but they needed help to get others on board.

I joined them to figure out how to achieve the long-term outcomes they were envisioning, as well as make some smaller “quality of life” improvements for customers along the way.

### Timeline

My official involvement lasted around 5 months.

There was not an obvious “start” or “end” date because this was not a clearly-scoped project. In fact, defining “done” was one of my biggest challenges!

## Challenge

### <span class="number">1</span>Help others see the opportunity

The first challenge was to help people see the latent opportunity in this part of our service.

As I’ve already mentioned, courses were not perceived as a revenue driver. Consequently, we invested in the experience very sparingly. We continued to add new courses, reaching about 40 at the time of this writing. In some ways, that put an extra strain on the navigation, which had been designed when we had far fewer courses.

### <span class="number">2</span>Clarify our vision for the future

Secondly, we had just declared this to be an “up and coming” area of our service by giving it a new, more expensive label in the main navigation. This is ironic given my first point about it’s relatively low priority.

So, the second challenge was to paint a more vivid picture of what the future would look like. This would obviously help us convince people to invest in it!

### <span class="number">3</span>Remain grounded in the present

Right on the heels of that was our third challenge: reaching into the future while remaining grounded in the present. We couldn’t just catch people on a grandiose vision of “someday”, we would need to help them see the practical steps required to get there.

Our process for prioritizing and selecting work tends to favor smaller, self contained efforts. There are many exceptions, of course, but we knew it would be important to boil down our proposals into something very practical, yet compelling enough to seem worthwhile and valuable.

I have a principle: “design in layers, implement in slices.“

## Technical Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was creating a reliable voice recognition system that could work effectively in noisy environments and understand diverse speech patterns, including users with speech impediments. We solved this by implementing a custom machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of voices and ambient conditions.

## Testimonial

<BlockQuote author="Maria Rodriguez, Beta Tester">
  This system has given me back my independence at home. The voice controls are so natural, and the haptic feedback
  helps me confirm every action without needing to see anything.

The project continues to evolve with regular updates based on user feedback, with a focus on expanding support for multiple languages and additional accessibility features.
