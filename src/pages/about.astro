      <Heading level="h2">What I'm best at</Heading>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Systems thinking and information architecture:</strong> bringing structural clarity to complex, data-heavy
          products through conceptual modeling, careful language, and productive debate
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Problem framing:</strong> turning ambiguity into well-defined opportunities so teams solve the *right*
          problem before investing in solutions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Domain fluency:</strong> developing working expertise in dense, technical spaces (healthcare, security,
          developer tools) and translating real constraints into humane, usable systems
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-functional influence:</strong> aligning design, product, and engineering around shared mental models
          without relying on formal authority
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research synthesis:</strong> extracting signal from messy inputs and connecting insights directly to strategic
          decisions
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Heading level="h2">What I love to do</Heading>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Solve real, worthwhile problems:</strong> working with teams committed to helping others achieve outcomes
          that matter to *them*, and building things we're proud to stand behind
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Go deep on fewer things:</strong> spending the time required to understand a problem space and address
          root causes, not just surface symptoms
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Design durable frameworks:</strong> creating structures that scale, adapt, and endure, not just screens
          that ship
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mentor designers:</strong> helping others strengthen their systems thinking, career judgment, and craft
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Heading level="h2">What the world needs</Heading>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal health and chronic disease:</strong> especially bone health and metabolic conditions, where clarity
          and long-term behavior change matter deeply
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable food systems:</strong> regenerative methods at scale, stronger local grower-consumer relationships,
          and better access to truly nourishing food
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Childhood education and life skills:</strong> restoring balance by reducing over-reliance on digital technology
          and investing in practical, valuable skills
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Faith in action:</strong> God was the first (and best) designer; our creative gifts are meant to serve
          others and reflect care, humility, and excellence
        </li>
      </ul>
